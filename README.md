📝 Vue Notes App (MVP)

A minimal notes-taking app built with Vue 3.
This was my very first Vue project, created as a way to learn the framework and better understand its concepts like components, reactivity, and state management.

🚀 Features

✍️ Create and save notes

🗑️ Delete notes

📋 View a list of all saved notes

⚡️ Lightweight, minimal design (MVP focus)

🎯 Purpose

This app is not production-ready — it’s a learning project I built to get hands-on experience with Vue 3.
The goal was to understand the basics of:

Vue 3 Composition API

Component-based architecture

Props & event handling

Simple state management

🛠️ Tech Stack

Vue 3 (Composition API)

Vue CLI (bundler & dev server)
